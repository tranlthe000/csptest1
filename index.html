    <h1>This is my second attempt of making it on my own in the real world</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Imagine if you were in the position where a girl told you that she loved you and that she would do anything to protect you
    <p>And that girl is really cute, with short blue hair and had a deacent cupsize (not too big, not too small)
    <p>Would you choose her and tell her that yes, you will become her boyfriend and spend the rest of your life with her,
    <p>Or tell her that you love another girl
    <p>But here's the thing, the other barely every helped you and while she is cute, she is not as cute as the blue haired girl
    <p>Now . . . choose your fate, live with the girl that loves you truely and has helped you dureing hard times,
    <p>or be turn her down and go with another girl that might not even like you as much as her? Copyright (C) 2018. All Right Researved
